# Models Directory

This directory contains trained ML models for the Enterprise MLOps Pipeline.

## Files

- `saved_model.pkl`: The trained Random Forest regression model (auto-generated)
- `metrics.json`: Model evaluation metrics (auto-generated by evaluate_model.py)

## Generating the Model

The model is automatically generated when you run the training pipeline:

python training/train_model.py

Or use the standalone generator:
python models/generate_model.py

## Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Features**: feature1, feature2
- **Target**: Continuous numerical value
- **Format**: Scikit-learn pickle file

## Usage

The model is loaded by the FastAPI deployment service:
